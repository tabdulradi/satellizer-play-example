# Play Backend Example for Authentication using Satellizer
Check [Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer/) for more information 

## TODO
- [ ] Implement rest of providers (Only Facebook is implemented now) 
- [ ] Moving Keys to Configuration files
- [ ] Moving the Authentication and Fething logic into seperate actors to keep controllers thin
- [ ] Use Akka http instead of Play WS to reduce dependency on Play 
- [ ] Moving the Actors into different project, to be re-usable for Spray 
- [ ] Move Controllers into a seperate Play plugin to be re-usable without copy/pase same code
